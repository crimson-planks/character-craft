How to use the generator:

Terms:
    MAIN: the directory that you unzipped this repository

Go to (your minecraft directory)/versions/(Your minecraft version)
Unzip the .jar file.

Put generate_block_list.py in (your minecraft directory)/versions/(Your minecraft version)/(the folder you unzipped)/data/minecraft/loot_tables/blocks and then run it.

Doing this will generate block_list.json
put this in the MAIN directory.

Run generate_data_pack.py
